He became very rude and asked me if I came to look for a Mexican husband. I never answered and kept quiet. He took the wrong route and made several in requested stops. Having in mind it was uberX. He continued asked me whom I sleep with. He literally stopped the car and asked me to wait for him text someone. I asked him to let me go and take a different driver but he locked the doors and didn't allow me.\n"
